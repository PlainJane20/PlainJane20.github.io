									<p style="font-size:20px">I’ve worked alongside Navi for more than three years now. In those three + years, I've seen her not only excel at the core elements of her job, as a compensation analyst and previously as a retirement specialist but also learn other tasks that extend well beyond the scope of her role, like initiating process improvement, acting as a reliable liaison between several departments and even championing our company's HRIS system. Navi has grown as quickly as our company has, and her willingness to learn and take on these new responsibilities is something to be desired in any professional atmosphere. Navi’s mastery for both her core role, and the projects that extend beyond it, have been critical to the company's growth. In fact, her taking on the internal company compensation analyst role aligned with a sharp increase in employee happiness. This rare mix of productivity and ambition sets a great example for the rest of the team, and explains why everyone enjoys working with Navi -- no matter where they fall on the organizational chart. While Navi’s work has continued to pay dividends long past her tenure here, I certainly look forward to working with her every day. I have only optimistic predictions for her career trajectory.</p>
